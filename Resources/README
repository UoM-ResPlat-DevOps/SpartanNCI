# About NCI and Gadi

National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) is Australia's peak facility for computational research and is located at ANU, Canberra.

Main HPC system in Gadi, Australia's peak research supercomputer; 9 PetaFLOP peak compute performance, 15 PFs theoretical. Number 24 in the Top 500 in June 2020.

# Getting An Account

Getting an account on Gadi is not as easy as Spartan.

There are merit allocations schemes, collaborator schemes, a start-up scheme for new users and an industry access scheme. 

Register for an account or new project at the MyNCI portal. `https://my.nci.org.au/`

The NCI Flagship Allocation Scheme provides for projects identified by the NCI Board as being of high-impact or national strategic 

Main access through National Computational Merit Allocation Scheme (NCMAS). `https://ncmas.nci.org.au`. Includes NCI (Gadi), Pawsey Centre (Magnus), Monash (MASSIVE), and UQ (FlashLite).

NCI Start-up Scheme, much smaller compute quota, used primarily for evaluation. Follow the 'propose a project' link on MyNCI portal to submit a start-up proposal. 

# Accessing Gadi

The hostname for Gadi is gadi.nci.org.au. As with similar systems logins are via SSH. The command `ssh username@Gadi.nci.org.au` will put the user one of the login nodes; use -Y for X-Windows forwarding.

Do consider using an SSH config and/or passwordless SSH, it will make things a lot easier

# Shell Environment

Gadi login configuation is located at `.config/gadi-login.conf`

This caan be used to change the the default project and the CLI shell that Gadi initiates, which is bash by default (e.g., `SHELL /bin/tcsh`). If you try to use a shell not registered it will default to bash.

# Modules and Scheduler

Gadi has software under a TCL enviroment modules scheme.

Gadi uses PBSPro for workload management, not Slurm. See PBS_Commands file.

There are sample job submission scripts in this directory for multicore, multinode, job dependencies, and job arrays on Gadi.
